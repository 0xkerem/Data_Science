It involves partitioning a dataset into complementary subsets, performing the analysis on one subset (called the training set), and validating the analysis on the other subset (called the validation set or testing set). This process is repeated multiple times (folds) to ensure that the model's performance is consistent and not due to random chance.\n\n## Why Do We Need Cross Validation?\n\n1. **Model Evaluation**: It provides a more reliable estimate of a model's performance than a single train/test split, especially on small datasets.\n   \n2. **Model Selection**: Helps in selecting the best model among different types by comparing their performance.\n\n3. **Parameter Tuning**: Assists in tuning hyperparameters of a model to achieve the best performance.\n\n4. **Detect Overfitting**: It helps to identify if the model is overfitting to the training data and performs poorly on unseen data.\n\n5. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: It provides a balance between bias and variance, leading to a more generalized model.\n\n## When Do We Need Cross Validation?\n\n1. **Small Datasets**: When the dataset is not large enough, cross-validation maximizes the amount of data used for training and testing.\n   \n2. **Model Comparison**: When you need to compare multiple machine learning models to find the best one for your data.\n\n3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: During the process of finding the optimal hyperparameters for a model.\n\n4. **Generalization**: When you want to ensure that your model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\n## When Do We Not Need Cross Validation?\n\n1. **Large Datasets**: When the dataset is large enough that a single train/test split can give a reliable estimate of model performance.\n   \n2. **Real-Time Predictions**: In real-time or streaming applications where splitting data into folds and training multiple models is impractical due to time constraints.\n\n3. **Data Leakage**: If there's a risk of data leakage between folds, which can happen if the data is not properly randomized or if there's temporal dependency.\n\n4. **Simplistic Models**: When using very simple models or in cases where the problem is straightforward and does not require extensive validation.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Types of Cross Validation in Scikit-Learn\nCross-validation is a key technique for assessing the performance and robustness of a machine learning model. **Scikit-learn** offers several methods for cross-validation, each suited to different types of data and use cases. Here is a detailed overview of the various cross-validation techniques provided by scikit-learn:\n\n## 1. K-Fold Cross Validation\n\nK-Fold Cross Validation is a robust method used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It involves dividing the dataset into `k` equal-sized subsets or \"folds.\" The model is trained `k` times, each time using a different fold as the validation set and the remaining folds as the training set. The final performance metric is the average of the metrics calculated for each fold. This method helps to ensure that the model's performance is not dependent on the specific partitioning of the dataset.\n\n#### How K-Fold Cross Validation Works\n1. **Divide the Data**: Split the data into `k` equal-sized folds.\n2. **Train and Validate**: For each fold:\n   - Train the model on `k-1` folds.\n   - Validate the model on the remaining fold.\n3. **Compute Metrics**: Calculate performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) for each fold.\n4. **Average Metrics**: Average the performance metrics across all folds to obtain a final evaluation.\n\n![K-Fold Cross Validation source: Towards Data Science](https://i.ibb.co/H7mLgkk/k-fold-cv.png)\n\n### When to Use K-Fold Cross Validation\n- **Small Datasets**: When you have limited data, K-Fold Cross Validation allows you to make the most of your data by ensuring each data point is used for both training and validation.\n- **Model Selection**: When selecting the best model from a set of candidate models, K-Fold Cross Validation provides a reliable estimate of each model’s performance.\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: It helps in tuning hyperparameters by providing a robust evaluation metric.\n- **Avoiding Overfitting**: It helps in detecting overfitting by ensuring that the model performs well on different subsets of the data.\n\n### Using K-Fold Cross Validation in Scikit-Learn\n\nScikit-learn provides a convenient way to implement K-Fold Cross Validation using the `KFold` class and `cross_val_score` function.\n\n### Key Parameters\n- `n_splits`: Number of folds.\n- `shuffle`: Whether to shuffle the data before splitting into folds.\n- `random_state`: Seed for random number generator to ensure reproducibility.\n\n### Advantages\n- **Robust Evaluation**: Provides a more reliable estimate of model performance.\n- **Efficient Use of Data**: Makes efficient use of limited data by utilizing every observation for both training and validation.\n- **Reduced Variance**: Reduces the variance of performance metrics compared to a single train-test split.\n\n### Disadvantages\n- **Computational Cost**: More computationally expensive than a single train-test split, especially for large datasets.\n- **Model Complexity**: May lead to more complex models due to the multiple training processes.\n\nBy using K-Fold Cross Validation, you can ensure a thorough and reliable evaluation of your machine learning models, leading to better model selection and improved generalization to unseen data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import KFold, cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\n# Load dataset\ndata = load_iris()\nX, y = data.data, data.target\n\n# Initialize model\nmodel = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200)\n\n# Define K-Fold Cross Validator\nkf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)\n\n# Perform Cross Validation\nscores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=kf, scoring='accuracy')\n\n# Print results\nprint(f\"Accuracy scores for each fold: {scores}\")\nprint(f\"Mean accuracy: {scores.mean()}\")","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.
